      Welcome to my webpage for Assignment 4!
      </p>
      <p>
      I created a side-by-side, interactive visualization using the building inventory data. 
      </p>
      </p>
      The visual on the left compares the Year Constructed with Square Footage. I wanted to see if there was a correlation between the two, in order to understand if one may influence the other.
      </p>
      </p>
      The visual on the right looks at the how many buildings had a certain number of total floors. It can be seen that having a single floor is most common among this dataset.
      </p>
      </p>
      Additionally, you can click and drag within the scatterplot graph to have a selection of data points. This selection can, then, be seen in the affect that it has on the bar graph. Also, by hovering your cursor over the data points, the information regarding the name of the location and the number of floors appears, for the purpose of more clarity of the data.
